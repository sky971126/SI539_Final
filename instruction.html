        Beautiful Nightscape Photography Is All About Technique
      </h2>
      <h3>
        The secret to producing beautiful nightscapes isn’t in a wide-angle lens, a high-end telescope, or a new Nikon or Canon DSLR camera—nor is it in post-processing or photo-editing software. These tools may help, but without technique, composition, and the knowledge to use your camera effectively, you won’t get anywhere. Whether you’re a beginner, intermediate, or advanced photographer, it’s important to focus on the fundamentals of good astrophotography. With these tips from the field, you’ll be ready to tackle your bucket-list dreams and shoot for big things—think auroras, eclipses, the deep sky—the possibilities are limitless.

      Choose a Subject
      </h2>
      <h3>
      Once you’ve chosen a photography subject, research moon phases and constellations with apps like Star Walk (for iPhone) or the free Google Sky Map (for Android) which show you the sky view from specific places at any time of the night. A full moon is the most popular of the eight moon phases to photograph, but you may want to shoot under a new moon to capture constellations in great detail.

      Which Moon or Lunar Phase Is Best for Night Photography?
      </h2>
      <div class="instruction-list">
        <ul id="Moon">
          <li class="Moon">New Moon:  If you want to photograph the Milky Way or capture fainter stars and starscapes, shoot under a new moon. Downside: the low light increases the noise or aberrant pixels that may occur with common nightscape settings, such as high ISO and a long exposure. Photographing under a new moon as opposed to the bright light of a full moon allows for the dark silhouettes of geologic features to pop out against a starry sky.
          </li>
          <li class="Moon">Full Moon:  Shooting under a full moon that is low in the sky serves to illuminate the foreground of your scene and drowns out potential light pollution, but this technique isn’t always ideal for celestial photography because it will obscure faint stars.
          </li>
          <li class="Moon">Quarter or Crescent Moon:  Want the best of both worlds—a detailed foreground and starry skies? Consider shooting with a crescent moon or quarter moon behind you to illuminate the foreground of your scene. If west-facing, shoot in early night (when the moon is low in the eastern sky). If east-facing, shoot in early morning (when the moon is low in the western sky).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>
        Select a Location
      </h2>
      <h3>
      For the darkest skies, go 60 to 100 miles from the city lights and get to high elevations. Notice the effect the high altitude and thinner atmosphere have on light refraction: Shooting through fewer light-dispersing particles creates crisper, brighter shots, with greater transparency and contrast.
  
      [Recommended Photograph: An image that compares high elevation, crisp astrophotography to a lower elevation photo with light pollution].

      <h2>
      Set Up Your Tripod
      </h2>
      <h3>
      As with any night photography, you’ll want to use a tripod. To master it, take a tip from one of the most renowned landscape photographers of all time, Ansel Adams. Adams urged for a methodical use of the tripod. Here’s how:
      </h3>
      <div class="instruction-list">
        <ul id="set">
          <li>Point one leg of the tripod at your subject so you can stand in between the other two legs.
          </li>
          <li>The central post of the tripod should be vertical and perpendicular; confirm this alignment with a bubble level.
          </li>
          <li>Acquire an L-bracket instead of a standard mounting plate to keep your camera’s weight evenly centered over the tripod.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>
        Frame Your Scene or Subject
      </h2>
      <h3>
      Frame one-third of the horizon against two-thirds of the night sky, and verify this a second time in your camera’s live view. This composition technique is called “the rule of thirds.”
      </h3>
